# Centralized_Motion_Planner_Project
Localized motion planning on-board an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) has been implemented. This individual motion planning of the route by AVs does not account for other AVs' routes, urgency, other such parameters and can lead to deadlock situations. A centralized computation unit that provides the registered AVs with a optimal motion plan is proposed by this project. A central planner will find a optimal motion plan for all the AVs in its control area. This central planner will consider the fuel constraint, priorities, speed constraint, etc while planning. This project proposes the use of Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for meta-heuristic centralized decoupled motion planning. A classic decoupled centralized motion planning algorithm will be implemented for baseline comparison. Advanced algorithm like Grey Wolf Optimization will be studied and explored in the project.
